# Slay the Jokers
A mod that allows your viewers to hover over cards on your stream to see their effects and current values.

Heads up! This mod requires additional setup steps before it can work.

If you need help or have suggestions feel free to contact me at itsedalo@gmail.com.

## Setup Instructions
- **Upload Key**: To use this mod, you'll need an upload key to the Slay the Jokers server.
1. Acquire an `upload.key` file using **one** of the following methods:
    - Email me at `itsedalo@gmail.com`
        - Absolutely no need for anything formal or polite, you can just say `Hi, I'm <twitch name>, give me a key.`, word for word if you want. I'll try to send you the key quickly.
    - Use the automated system at https://edalo.net/stj/get-key (you will need to verify your Twitch account to prove it's really you)
        - This feature is new; if something fails, fall back to emailing me
2. Place `upload.key` in the `Balatro` folder (`%appdata%\Balatro`)
3. Enable the [extension](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/iaofk5k6d87u31z9uy2joje2fwn347) on your Twitch channel

## Things to Know Before Installing
- **Stream Overlays**: This mod currently only works correctly if the game is shown at a 16:9 resolution (like 1920x1080 / 4K / 8K) and **fills the entire visible area of the stream**. Overlays that crop or reposition the game may cause card positions to misalign.
    - If that's a dealbreaker, feel free to contact me - I might be able to make it work for your setup.

- **Windows Only**: This mod currently supports only **\*Windows\*** systems.

- **Other Mods & Compatibility**: This mod should be compatible with most other mods.
    - Compatible mods:
        - Reskins, QoL mods, and other non-card-related mods should work in their entirety, but have not been tested (except for the [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) mod, which was confirmed to work).
        -  Mods that add new cards should generally work, aside from some potential minor formatting quirks. Among mods that were confirmed to work are [Extra Credit](https://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit), [Paperback](https://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback), [Neato](https://github.com/neatoqueen/NeatoJokers), [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid), and [The Balatro Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayer).
    - Incompatible mods:
        - Mods that modify existing card effects are **not** compatible (the original card's effect will be shown instead).

- **Disclaimer**: This mod is still under development, so some features might not work perfectly. If you encounter any issues, please let me know!
    - *More formal disclaimer for meanies: this project is a hobby project, provided as-is, with no guarantees of stability, correctness, or suitability for any purpose. You're welcome to use it - but I take no responsibility if something goes wrong.*
